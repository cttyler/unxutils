This directory contains the GNU diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp utilities 
modified to work with WIN32. All Windows specific sections should be 
labeled by WIN32 defines.
To build from the sources, just put the Windows gcc-2.95.2 on your path,
type make and keep you fingers crossed. The Cygwin-gcc with the -mnocygwin
flag may work, too.
